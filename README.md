# ISfinalProj  

## Overview  
ISfinalProj is a project that integrates machine learning models with a structured dataset for analysis and prediction. The project consists of a dataset, ML model, views, and an application script to interact with the system.  

## Features  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implements predictive analytics and decision-making.  
- **Data Handling:** Processes and structures datasets for training and evaluation.  
- **Web Interface (Views):** Handles user interactions and displays results.  
- **Backend (app.py):** Manages requests and integrates various components.  

## Installation  
To set up the project, follow these steps:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ISfinalProj.git
   cd ISfinalProj
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the application using Streamlit:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
